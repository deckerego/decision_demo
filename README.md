The Decision Demo
=================

A Play 2.3/Scala application that demos how you can use decision tables and rules engines to replace conditional code blocks


Running
-------

This demo requires Play 2.3+, Scala 2.11 and Activator to be installed. The Activator launcher is not bundled as part of the repository, so your local activator command will execute the project:

    activator run
